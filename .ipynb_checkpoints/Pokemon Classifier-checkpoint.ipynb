    "For this assignment, we were given the task of taking part in a hackathon, where we source a dataset of our choice and carry out some sort of meaningful analyses. Since video games are something I've thoroughly indulged in throughout my life, I chose to source a dataset relating to a personal favourite game of mine - Pokémon. For those who don't know, Pokémon in its original form was a game created by Japanese game developer 'Game Freak', where the player takes the role of a Pokémon trainer, catching Pokémon and battling them against eachother trainer's Pokémon in turn based combat. Although early releases of the game had the player battle against non-player characters (NPCs), a combination of its massive media success and its strategic nature has led to Pokémon's now well established competitive scene. \n",
    "\n",
    "A highly visited site, Smogon, is the hub of competitive Pokémon battling, where every Pokémon is designated a 'tier'. Instead of usual tier systems, where rankings are based on viability set by the developers, Smogon instead classifies a Pokémon's tier by a product of its usage. The logic behind this is that stronger Pokémon will have greater usage in competitive battles, with less used Pokémon nearly always weaker or more niche. In this way, the tier of a Pokémon is dictated by the whole player base, and Pokémon constantly shift between tiers depending on what is 'meta'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pokémon has released a plethora of games since its first release in 1996. Every several years since 1996, Game Freak has released a group of Pokémon games that introduce new mechanics and Pokémon. These releases are referred to as generations, with the latest installment, generation VIII, released in 2019. "

    "Whilst many people battle Pokémon purely for its enjoyment, there also exists a multitude of tournaments held online and at events around the world. The largest event, the annual Pokémon World Championships, has players compete for over half a million dollars in prize money and the adoration of the Pokémon community. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, every new generation sees the current competitive metagame become a chaotic state. When new Pokémon are introduced, it takes time for the metagame to adjust to the presence of new pokemon. For example, when a DLC named \"Isle of Armour\" was released for the latest generation of Pokémon games in June 2020, the competitive scene became unstable for a time. With The Pokémon Company announcing its newest generation of Pokémon games set to be released in late 2022, a tool such as this would assist players in expediting a period normally in a state of flux, resulting in a more stable competitive scene.

    "Each Pokémon has a type, with some Pokémon having two types (known as dual-type). Types refer to different elemental properties associated with Pokémon and their moves, and determines the effectiveness of moves on the Pokémon. For example, water type moves deal 'supereffective' (2x) damage to fire type Pokémon. This also works the other way - water type moves deal 'not very effective' (0.5x) damage to grass Pokémon. Although most type matchups are set up logically, a total number of 18 types lends itself to a variety of interactions. Don't worry too much about what is effective against what. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the typing of a Pokémon will affect its offensive potential through a mechanic called \"Same Type Attack Bonus\" (STAB). If a Pokémon uses a move of the same type as itself, then the move will deal 1.5x damage. For example, if an electric type Pokémon uses an electric type move, then the move will deal 1.5x damage compared to using a move of a different type. \n",
    "\n",
    "All Pokémon types are not created equally - different types have more relevant strengths and weaknesses. Some types are naturally better than others due to having either better offensive or defensive matchups against the metagame. For example, the 'fairy' type is currently considered the best type in the metagame due to its offensive and defensive matchups against other viable types. "

    "I did a quick search on the internet to try and find a Pokémon ability tier list constructed either by the Pokémon community or a professional player. I managed to find [All Pokémon Abilities Tier List](https://tiermaker.com/categories/pokemon/all-pokmon-abilities-703354) created by community voters, which consists of the cumulative average rankings from 39 submitted tier lists. Although these rankings are completely subjective and there is no way of validating the competitive knowledge of the people who submitted, it is simply the best option we have. Moreover, the abilities are represented by pictures, so there is no of scraping the data... we have to code the abilities manually. \n",

    "So, we rank the abilities from `0` (the ability has an adverse effect or no competitive use), to `6` (game-changingly powerful). After that, we create a new column in our dataset, which will hold the value of each Pokémon's strongest ability. "

For example, a Pokémon's stats can go beyond 100, which we don't want to be valued as greated than it's ability, which will always be 6 or less.

    "If we have a look at our results, we can see that there are 14 \"Gmax\" Pokemon which have been misclassified. Generation 8 introduced a new mechanic in Pokémon called dynamaxing. Some Pokémon, upon dynamaxing, change form completely and become much stronger 'Gmax' versions of themselves, gaining a variety of powerful effects. Due to having such a negative impact on the Pokémon metagame, dynamaxing as a whole was banned from the OU tier and below. Every Pokémon with a 'Gmax' form now resides in the AG tier. This has implications for our classifier, which classifies Pokemon based on their stats, ability, and typing, not by their name. Let's try removing \"Gmax\" pokemon from the dataset and see if our accuracy improves"

    "From the results it's clear that our classifier isn't actually doing too bad a job. It's classification is generally along the right direction, as it is often classifying Pokemon into adjacent tiers (e.g. An NU Pokemon as RU or PU). This could be due to the cardinality of the tiers. Since our dataset is fairly small (only 770 entries after our data tidying), it's possible that we simply have too little data for our classifier to handle such a high cardinality output. Let's try reducing the cardinality by grouping the tiers together and see if we can make an improvement."

    "In this hackathon, I've trained a classifier to be able to ascertain any given Pokémon's competitive viability. By using a Pokémon's stats, typing, ability, and evolution status as input variables, we achieved around 82% model accuracy. Although this isn't particularly high, it is worth taking into consideration our relatviely small dataset, which consists of only 770 entries. Moreover, the data don't have much redundancy, as Pokémon are specifially designed to be unique.   \n",
    "\n",
    "To increase model accuracy, the next step would be to include each Pokémon's moveset into the classifier. The moves a Pokémon can learn has arguably has the largest impact on its competitive viability. For example, a Pokémon which only learnt the move \"celebrate\" (which has no effect) would be completely useless, regardless of their other attributes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, there is no web page that exists detailing all of the 826 moves and which can be learnt by each Pokémon! Even if one existed and we managed to add it to our dataset, we would have to properly encode them. Like abilites, there is no quantifiable method to ranking them, and we would be left to subjectively rank all 826 moves!\n",
    "\n",
    "As a last word, another major factor that I haven't yet touched upon is that Pokémon are not independent from eachother. For example, if a certain Pokémon rose to prominance in the metagame, then Pokémon to counter it would also suddenly rise in usage, and so on. Our classifier will unfortunetely never capture all of the nuances in the Pokémon metagame, although at least we've given it a good shot!"
